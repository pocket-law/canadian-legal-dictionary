The appellant, Anton Piller, was a German manufacturer of motors and electric generators used in the computing industry. The respondent was the appellant's agent in the United Kingdom. As agents the respondents had received confidential information surrounding the appellant's business. The appellants found out that the respondents had been in secret communication with other German companies called Ferrostaal and Lechmotoren with a view to giving those companies detailed plans and drawings of the appellant's products so that they could be copied. The appellants were about to launch a new product and feared that details of it might get into the hands of competitors if the respondents were forewarned that the appellants were aware of the respondents' breaches of confidence. Anton Piller commenced ex parte proceedings seeking an injunction to restrain copyright infringement as well as a court order to permit entry to the respondent's premises to search and remove all confidential information owned by the appellants. The injunction was granted but the order for inspection and removal was refused. The appellants appealed the denial of the latter order. In the Court of Appeal the order was granted. From this initial order has grown the jurisprudence on Anton Piller orders, commonly known as civil search warrants.",

Youth custody facilities must not have any adult offenders confined with youths. Under section 85 of the YCJA, provinces must designate the level of youth custody facilities: \u201copen\u201d or \u201csecure.\u201d The youth justice court judge determines the level of custody, while the provincial director determines the specific facility that a youth will be placed in and may move the youth from one facility to another within the designated level. There is significant variation in the size and nature of custody facilities both between and within jurisdictions. Youth custody facilities range from large institutions to small treatment-oriented group homes.",

The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. has a system for organizing material by topic that is used by major libraries throughout the world. Library of Congress Subject Headings are a controlled vocabulary used to describe the topic of a book. Thus, all books in a law library that relate to human rights law in Ontario will be assigned the subject heading \u201cHuman rights \u2014 Ontario\u201d and searching in an online library catalogue on that specific subject heading will retrieve all books on that subject held by the library. Related to these subject headings are Library of Congress call numbers that are assigned to a book depending on the book\u2019s topic. The \u201cLaw of Canada\u201d is usually assigned the starting letters \u201cKE\u201d followed by a number that relates to the topic (KE 850 would likely be a book on Canadian contract law). Some Canadian law libraries, however, use the \u201cKF\u201d letters to organize their Canadian legal materials (KF is ordinarily the \u201cLaw of America\u201d and when Canadian law libraries use KF for Canadian materials, it is referred to as \u201cKF Modified\u201d).",

Rescission is a remedy granted to a plaintiff in the case of fraud, innocent misrepresentation, or because of some other action on the defendant's behalf that amounts to undue influence, unconscionability, or makes the bargain questionable on some other equitable grounds. Rescission in equity operates to roll the contract back to the position the parties were in prior to contracting. This is referred to as rescission ab initio, or \"from the beginning.\" It is to be distinguished from rescission de futuro, or \"for the future.\" The latter terminology is unwisely used to describe the position of a plaintiff who is entitled to terminate a contract for breach. As an equitable remedy rescission is subject to a number of discretionary barriers including delay and affirmation. It is also important for the plaintiff to be able to effect restitutio in integrium. That requires both parties to be restored to their pre-contractual positions. The degree of complete restoration will vary depending on the particular underlying cause of action. In the case of fraud a court will be less particular with giving complete restoration, whereas for an innocent misrepresentation, anything less that complete restoration will bar rescission.",

On the other hand, the owner of a right of remuneration cannot prevent the use of his material by any user who tenders the prescribed fee.

The typical Court of Equity decision would prevent a person from enforcing a common law court judgment. The kings delegated this special judicial review power over common law court rulings to chancellors. A new branch of law developed known as \"equity\", with their decisions eventually gaining precedence over those of the common law courts. A whole set of equity law principles were developed based on the predominant \"fairness\" characteristic of equity such as \"equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy\" or \"he who comes to equity must come with clean hands\". Many legal rules, in countries that originated with English law, have equity-based law such as the law of trusts and mortgages.",

The period of time, in a foreclosure, that the court will establish for which the property will be for sale before the owner will have to vacate and the time at which potentially the mortgage holder can take control of the property.If there is a significant anticipated shortfall the lawyer for the mortgage holder will argue for no redemption period. If there is anticipated equity then the owner of the property will ask the court for a longer redemption period so the property can be sold in an orderly manner and not as a \"fire sale\", thus allowing the owner to sell for as high a price as possible and therefore not suffer a loss or worse a shortfall. Typically the courts will grant a 6 month redemption period if there is a likelihood of some equity or a small shortfall.",
