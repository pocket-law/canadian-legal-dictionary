Rescission in equity operates to roll the contract back to the position the parties were in prior to contracting. This is referred to as rescission ab initio, or \"from the beginning.\" It is to be distinguished from rescission de futuro, or \"for the future.\" The latter terminology is unwisely used to describe the position of a plaintiff who is entitled to terminate a contract for breach. As an equitable remedy rescission is subject to a number of discretionary barriers including delay and affirmation. It is also important for the plaintiff to be able to effect restitutio in integrium. That requires both parties to be restored to their pre-contractual positions. The degree of complete restoration will vary depending on the particular underlying cause of action. In the case of fraud a court will be less particular with giving complete restoration, whereas for an innocent misrepresentation, anything less that complete restoration will bar rescission.",

The appropriateness of a particular sanction is largely determined by the needs of the victims, and the community, as well as the offender. The focus is on the human beings closely affected by the crime” (at 726).",

Thus, a copyright holder can get an injunction to prevent the translation of her work, however much money the user tenders for the right and however worthy the enterprise. On the other hand, the owner of a right of remuneration cannot prevent the use of his material by any user who tenders the prescribed fee. For example, the copyright holder of a published sound recording of a musical work cannot prevent a broadcaster who tenders the appropriate payment from airing any sound recording; the Copyright Act grants the right-holder only a right of remuneration in respect of this activity.",

The 2012 amendments expanded the concept of violent offence to include offences where the youth endangers the life or safety of another, even if there is no intent to cause harm. The fact that a youth is charged with a violent offence means that the youth may be eligible for pre-trial detention or custody, and even if it is a first offence, there is no presumption of use of extrajudicial sanctions. ",

		"definition": "Tribunals are not courts. Workplace administrative tribunals are specialized dispute adjudication forums created by the provincial government to decide blame and liability for the violation of certain provincial laws dealing with employment issues or the violation of a collective agreement’s terms.\n
		Unlike the judges in courts, tribunal appointees are not necessarily trained lawyers, and tribunals are not “courts of record,” meaning that there are no transcripts of proceedings unless one of the parties before the tribunal chooses to engage a shorthand reporter, which can be done only with the tribunal’s permission. The decisions of Ontario workplace administrative tribunals can be overturned (appealed) only by making application for judicial review to the Divisional Court.\n
		The following are the primary private sector workplace administrative tribunals in Ontario:\n
		Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO)\n
		Ontario Labour Relations Board (OLRB)\n
		Pay Equity Hearings Tribunal\n
		Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal\n
		An arbitrator appointed under the provisions of a collective agreement is also a workplace administrative tribunal. In addition to the above list, there are specialized workplace administrative tribunals that deal with specific public sector employment issues, for example, the Grievance Settlement Board for Ontario, which adjudicates the grievances of Crown employees in the Ontario public service.",
