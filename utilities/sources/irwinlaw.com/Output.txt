A situation in which an offender is deemed not to have been convicted of the offence. However, since the offender pleaded or was found guilty, the offender will still have a federal criminal record.

An absolute discharge cannot be given if the offence carries a minimum punishment or is punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or life.

<related_terms>
Adult, Jury, Youth justice court
<definition>
A youth fourteen years or older may have an adult sentence imposed; this is generally only considered if the offence is one of the most serious offences. If the Crown wishes to have the youth justice court impose an adult sentence, the youth must receive notice before trial and will have the right to a jury trial. An adult sentence can be imposed only after a youth justice court determines under section 72 of the YCJA that a youth sentence would “not be of sufficient length to hold the young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour.” If the youth justice court determines that an adult-length sentence is appropriate, the youth cannot be placed in an adult facility until reaching the age of eighteen years, and there is a discretion in the court to delay transfer to an adult facility through early adulthood.

<definition>
A system of justice premised on each party having an obligation to present evidence and argument to support its position, though there are special obligations of fairness for the Crown prosecutor. A hallmark of Canada’s adversarial system is that the judge, a neutral figure, remains relatively passive during a trial. In the inquisitorial model of justice used in some European countries, judges play a more active role in investigating the alleged offence and questioning witnesses.
