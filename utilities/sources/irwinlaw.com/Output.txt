Adult, Jury, Youth justice court
<definition>
A youth fourteen years or older may have an adult sentence imposed; this is generally only considered if the offence is one of the most serious offences. If the Crown wishes to have the youth justice court impose an adult sentence, the youth must receive notice before trial and will have the right to a jury trial. An adult sentence can be imposed only after a youth justice court determines under section 72 of the YCJA that a youth sentence would “not be of sufficient length to hold the young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour.” If the youth justice court determines that an adult-length sentence is appropriate, the youth cannot be placed in an adult facility until reaching the age of eighteen years, and there is a discretion in the court to delay transfer to an adult facility through early adulthood.

A system of justice premised on each party having an obligation to present evidence and argument to support its position, though there are special obligations of fairness for the Crown prosecutor. A hallmark of Canada’s adversarial system is that the judge, a neutral figure, remains relatively passive during a trial. In the inquisitorial model of justice used in some European countries, judges play a more active role in investigating the alleged offence and questioning witnesses.

Anton Piller order
<definition>
Anton Piller order takes its name from a decision of the English Court of Appeal in Anton Piller K.G. v. Manufacturing Processes Ltd., [1976] Ch. 55 (C.A.). The appellant, Anton Piller, was a German manufacturer of motors and electric generators used in the computing industry. The respondent was the appellant's agent in the United Kingdom. As agents the respondents had received confidential information surrounding the appellant's business. The appellants found out that the respondents had been in secret communication with other German companies called Ferrostaal and Lechmotoren with a view to giving those companies detailed plans and drawings of the appellant's products so that they could be copied. The appellants were about to launch a new product and feared that details of it might get into the hands of competitors if the respondents were forewarned that the appellants were aware of the respondents' breaches of confidence. Anton Piller commenced ex parte proceedings seeking an injunction to restrain copyright infringement as well as a court order to permit entry to the respondent's premises to search and remove all confidential information owned by the appellants. The injunction was granted but the order for inspection and removal was refused. The appellants appealed the denial of the latter order. In the Court of Appeal the order was granted. From this initial order has grown the jurisprudence on Anton Piller orders, commonly known as civil search warrants.

They set out the fundamental characteristics of the corporation — for example, its name, the class and number of shares authorized to be issued, any restrictions on transferring shares, and any restrictions on the business the corporation may carry on. Once the director issues a certificate to which the articles are attached, a corporation with the characteristics set out in the articles comes into existence.

Arms length, Profits
<definition>
The concept of associated enterprises applies typically in tax treaties and encapsulates the arm's-length principle. An enterprise of one contracting state may engage in commercial dealings with an enterprise of the other contracting state that is under common control, management, or ownership. If the two enterprises deal under conditions that would not have been imposed on an independent enterprise, a contracting state may include as taxable profits of the enterprise amounts that would have been derived by the enterprise in an arm's-length relationship.

<definition>
AFIS is a searchable database of persons who have been lawfully fingerprinted under the authority of the Identification of Criminals Act. In Canada, AFIS is managed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Canadian Criminal Real Time Identification Services — CCRTIS) in Ottawa. Federal, provincial, regional, and municipal police services have access to AFIS through local network users groups. AFIS is not relied upon to confirm or exclude identity. It is simply used to narrow the potential search down to fingerprints with similar features (e.g., pattern type and minutiae). Identifications remain the task of qualified fingerprint examiners and are subsequently and independently verified by another qualified examiner.

Criminal Procedure 3/e - Steve Coughlan
<definition>
Under Canadian law, with a few exceptions (such as murder), there is a presumption that an accused should be given some form of pretrial release unless it can be established that her detention until trial is necessary. There are various forms of release available. “Bail” refers to the form of release in which an amount of contingent debt is pledged by the accused as a condition of release pending trial (her “own bail”), or by her “surety” (a “surety bail”) or, in some limited circumstances, the accused must make a cash deposit (“cash bail”). In the vast majority of situations, however, bail refers to the first two situations, in which a legally binding pledge is made to pay the Crown a sum of money (the bail amount) only if and when the terms of the release are violated. In a surety bail, the surety makes the pledge and owes the Crown the bail amount in the event that the accused does not comply with the court’s terms of release.

Mental Health Courts - Richard D. Schneider, Hy Bloom and Mark Heerema
<definition>
A court hearing, usually held soon after the initial arrest, at which it is determined whether the accused will be detained in a custody facility pending trial or released, often with some conditions imposed (e.g., refraining from contacting the complainant). Technically in the Criminal Code, a bail hearing is referred to as a “judicial interim release hearing.” It is also called a “show cause hearing,” since the onus is generally on the Crown to show why the accused should not be released pending trial. “Detention before sentencing” is largely governed by the provisions of Part XVI of the Criminal Code, which determine whether an accused person should be detained, modified by provisions of sections 28 to 31 of the YCJA, which encourage release of youths, allow for release under parental supervision, and require detention separate from adults.

Bills can be public (if they are of general application) or private (if they only affect one organization or entity). A bill must pass all three readings and come into force prior to the proroguing of the legislature to become law.

Bill C-32
<definition>
The Copyright Amendment Bill of 1996, introduced into the Canadian House of Commons on 25 April 1996. The bill increases the rights of record companies and performers, gives Canadian book distributors the right to stop unauthorized imports or distribution, and provides some exemptions for libraries, archives, museums, and people with disabilities. References are to Bill C-32 as it stood at its second reading stage in June 1996. The bill was referred to a parliamentary committee to hold hearings and, at press time, was likely to be presented with a number of amendments for third reading. It is projected to be passed by 1997.

The Copyright Modernization Bill of 2010, which proposed to amend Canadian copyright law and which received its first reading in the House of Commons on 2 June  2010. It aimed to update copyright law for the age of digital technologies and allow ratification of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996. It is debatable whether the bill's overall recalibration of the balance of rights between copyright owners and users is fair or not. The bill died in March 2011 with the fall of the Harper government.

Capital cost allowance (CCA)
<definition>
A tax deduction for business-related capital property that provides for the depreciation of these assets. Businesses can deduct up to a fixed percentage of the depreciated cost each year. CCA may differ from depreciation used for financial statement purposes. For example, in certain cases, the CCA rates at which assets can be written off against income may be faster than the rates used in companies' financial accounts.

Income Tax Law 2/e - Vern Krishna
<definition>
Under the Income Tax Act, a person carrying on a business may deduct from income of the business capital cost allowance (CCA) in relation to depreciable property. Notionally, this deduction reflects the decline in the remaining useful life of certain kinds of property used in the business, like equipment, which has occurred over the year. It is similar, in this respect, to the accounting concept of depreciation. In practice, the Income Tax Act sets specific percentages of the acquisition or capital cost of property that may be deducted for a number of broad classes of property. These annual percentage deductions may or may not reflect the decline in the remaining useful life of property over a year. As well, the government may increase or accelerate permitted CCA deductions for certain kinds of property to encourage investment in targeted industries that use these kinds of property.

A test that appears in several places in the CBCA and compares the realizable value of the corporation’ assets to its liabilities and stated capital. The test must be satisfied before certain actions, such as declaring dividends and redeeming and repurchasing shares, may be taken by the board of directors. Different formulations of the test are used as a condition of the directors being permitted to take particular actions. To be permitted to declare dividends, the directors must have reasonable grounds to believe that the realizable value of the corporation’s assets is not less than its liabilities and the stated capital of all classes.

Caution
<definition>
A form of extrajudicial measure that involves a police officer or a prosecutor meeting with the youth, and often the parents, to warn the youth against further offending, and perhaps make a voluntary referral for counselling or support from some agency. A record is kept of the caution, as a future charge may be dealt with more formally, but record of a caution cannot be used in youth justice court proceedings. There is no legal distinction between a “warning“ and a “caution,” but the term “warning” generally refers to an informal caution, given by the investigating officer at the time of apprehension of a youth.

Challenge for cause
<definition>
The process by which the Crown or the accused can challenge a potential juror in order to suggest that the person should not serve on the jury. The most common basis for challenge for cause is that the juror is not indifferent between the Queen and the accused, which amounts to a claim that the juror will not act impartially.

Sections 1–34 of the Constitution Act, 1982, setting out various guaranteed rights which, subject to the justification clause in section 1 of the Charter, take priority over any other legislation. The most important sections for criminal law purposes in­clude the fundamental freedoms guaranteed in section 2 (such as freedom of expression), the legal rights provisions in sections 7–14 (such as freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, and the right to counsel), and the remedies provisions in sections 24 and 52.

Criminal Procedure 3/e - Steve Coughlan
<definition>
The part of the Constitution Act, 1982, that guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals in their relationship to the government and its agents. The Charter can be invoked by a judge to exclude evidence that was obtained by the police in violation of guaranteed rights if its admission in court proceedings “would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.” In some cases, a Charter violation may result in a judicial stay of proceedings. The Charter is occasionally used to nullify pieces of legislation, as, for example, happened when the Supreme Court of Canada declared unconstitutional the provisions of the YCJA that created a presumption of adult sentencing (R. v. D.B., 2008 SCC 25).

Circle sentencing
<definition>
A method of sentencing sometimes used with Aboriginal offenders (and occasionally with other offenders). Typically, the judge, lawyers, police, offender and parents, victim, and other community members and professionals sit in a circle. Everyone has an opportunity to express their feelings about the offence and offender, and their views about an appropriate sentence. If a consensus emerges about an appropriate sentence, the judge will usually impose this sentence, though the judge is not obliged to do so. A body of jurisprudence deals with the appropriateness of circle sentencing for adults, and section 41 of the YCJA recognizes the judicially convened “conference,” which includes the possibility of circle sentencing.

Criminal Procedure 3/e - Steve Coughlan
<definition>
The law in areas not governed by statute consisting of the accumulation of rules made in judicial decisions. Once a rule is applied in a particular case, it becomes a precedent: all courts lower in the judicial hierarchy are bound to decide all subsequent cases in a manner consistent with this rule. The application of the rule from the precedent case to different facts in subsequent cases clarifies and refines the rule. As a result of this binding character of precedent cases, it is often said that common law is made by judges.

<related_terms>
Community programs, Community service, Community service order, Conditional supervision, Custody, Youth justice court
<definition>
When a youth justice court imposes a sentence of “custody and supervision” under section 42(2)(n) of the YCJA, the first two-thirds of the sentence is the “custodial portion,” while the last one-third is to be served in the community under a supervision order. The period of supervision is subject to mandatory conditions regarding reporting set out in section 97(1) of the YCJA, and the provincial director may impose other conditions to “promote reintegration of the youth” into the community or “protection of the public.” There is an expectation that the youth will have a level of supervision and support from youth workers while living in the community. If there is a “serious” breach of the conditions, the youth may be returned to custody subject to court review under section 103. Before expiry of the custodial portion of a sentence, a provincial director may apply to a youth justice court under section 98 for an order that the youth remain in custody rather than being released under community supervision.

Was the traditional English term to refer to the entity created under English registration model statutes, and it is still used in the UK Companies Act2006. Following the English practice, “company” was used in early Canadian legislation and is still the proper term in two provinces: Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Under the CBCA and in the provinces and territories with corporate legislation modelled after it, “corporation” is the proper term. Nevertheless, even in reference to entities incorporated in these jurisdictions, “company” is still used colloquially. “Company” is also used colloquially to refer to a collection of people engaged in any common activity.

Community supervision, Custody, Youth justice court
<definition>
When a youth is sentenced to a period of custody for murder, manslaughter, attempted murder, or aggravated sexual assault under section 42(2)(o) or section 42(2)(q) of the YCJA, or sentenced for a serious offence to “intensive rehabilitative custody” under section 42(2)(r), the last portion is to be served under “conditional supervision” in the community. A youth on “conditional supervision” is subject to stricter legal controls than a youth on “community supervision.” Before the date scheduled for release under conditional supervision, a youth justice court hearing is to be held under section 105 to determine the conditions of release, or decide that the last portion of the sentence is to be served in custody. Subject to later court review, a provincial director may return a youth on conditional supervision to custody if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a youth has breached or is about to breach a condition of release.

<definition>
A conference is a group of persons who meet to provide advice for dealing with a youth in the youth justice system. The concept is flexible, but normally the youth, parents of the youth, community representatives, and the victim are invited to participate. A police officer, a youth justice court judge, or the provincial director may convene a conference. A conference may give advice on appropriate extrajudicial measures, conditions for release from pretrial detention or custody, sentence, or sentence review. The conference concept is intended to allow a more restorative and community-based response to be taken to youth offending.

A measure of the personal idiosyncratic value that a person places on having possession of a particular chattel or realty. Consumer surplus is a measure of the price that an individual is prepared to pay, over and above the market value, for a particular commodity or service. There is a real fear that consumer surplus will be under-compensated when assessing damages for breach of contract or tort because it is based on idiosyncratic and subjective values and is therefore difficult to measure.

The term refers to the government or state, or prosecution team, in youth justice court or adult criminal cases. In some contexts, the term “Crown” refers to the lawyer who represents the Crown in court; this person may also be referred to as the Crown attorney or Crown prosecutor. Occasionally, if the Crown is unwilling to prosecute, cases are prosecuted “privately,” typically by the victim or a lawyer acting on the victim’s behalf, but this is rare in youth justice court as section 24 of the YCJA requires the consent of the Attorney General to a private prosecution of a young person.

Cruelty
<definition>
The title of crimes against animals in the Criminal Code and a term commonly used to describe unacceptable human treatment of animals; the term is generally undefined in Canadian law and likely out of date. It connotes a malevolent intent which implies a high standard to be met before harm to an animal is considered a legal wrong. So long as there is some human purpose motivating the act and the harm is not gratuitous, it is not likely to be found to be cruel, however serious the harm to the animal and however trivial the human purpose.

<definition>
The most severe sentence that can be imposed by a youth justice court under the YCJA is to place a youth in “custody,” which requires that the youth reside in a facility. Youth custody facilities must not have any adult offenders confined with youths. Under section 85 of the YCJA, provinces must designate the level of youth custody facilities: “open” or “secure.” The youth justice court judge determines the level of custody, while the provincial director determines the specific facility that a youth will be placed in and may move the youth from one facility to another within the designated level. There is significant variation in the size and nature of custody facilities both between and within jurisdictions. Youth custody facilities range from large institutions to small treatment-oriented group homes.

De minimis non curat lex
<definition>
De minimis is a shortened form of the Latin legal maxim de minimis non curat lex: the law does not concern itself with the trivial. For example, an act that is technically an infringement can be called de minimis if it is thought to be outside the purpose of the law to catch it; the claim can then be dismissed with costs. This decision involves a value judgment that the complaint should either have been resolved without taking up the time of a court or is a minor irritant that, like the unintentional jostle in a crowded street, the complainant should have borne with equanimity.

<related_terms>
Conditional sentence, Custody
<definition>
If a youth is convicted of an offence that did not involve the youth causing, or attempting to cause, serious bodily harm, a youth court may impose a sentence that places the youth in the community subject to various conditions, with the provision that if any of the conditions are breached the youth may serve the remainder of the sentence as a custody order. In the event of breach or “apprehended breach” of a condition, the youth may be placed in custody without a prior court hearing, though subject to later court review. A sentence of “deferred custody and supervision” under section 42(2)(p) of the YCJA is similar to a “conditional sentence” for adults under the Criminal Code. The conditions may result in a youth being under “house arrest” in the community, or the conditions may give a youth the freedom to attend school, have employment, obtain counselling, or engage in other activities.

Income
<definition>
A business accounting concept. Income for tax purposes must always be calculated and taxes paid in accordance with the rules set out in the Income Tax Act. However, businesses' methods of calculating their income for financial statement purposes often differ from those used for tax purposes, and thus companies' income for financial statement purposes will often differ from (and appear greater than) the income on which businesses actually have to pay taxes. In order to reconcile these two amounts in their books, businesses use the accounting concept of deferred taxes.

Mental Health Courts - Richard D. Schneider, Hy Bloom and Mark Heerema
<definition>
This principle of sentencing is based on the idea that punishing offenders should cause a reduction in future offending because of a desire to avoid punishment. “Specific deterrence” is concerned with punishment to inhibit reoffending by the person being sentenced; “general deterrence” uses the punishment of one offender as a warning to other potential offenders of the consequences of offending. Under the Criminal Code, section 718(b), courts may consider both specific and general deterrence in sentencing an adult. The 2012 YCJAamendments allow a youth court to consider specific deterrence when sentencing a youth, but not general deterrence.

In patent law, the giving up of anything beyond what the inventor truly invented. In trade-mark law: (1) The giving up of any unregistrable parts of a trade-mark — for example, descriptive language on a label — when seeking registration. The mark owner may, however, have common law rights in the disclaimed material, which still forms part of the mark. Disclaimers take effect on being recorded on the respective CIPO register. (2) A notice, such as "my business or trade-mark is not associated with firm X or mark X," that is designed to minimize confusion between two trade-names or trade-marks. A clear and prominent notice that achieves this goal may help to avoid a passing-off or trade-mark infringement action.

Under the Young Offenders Act, this term referred to a sentence imposed by a youth justice court on a youth who was found guilty of an offence. The Youth Criminal Justice Act uses the term “sentence,” which is the same as the term used for adults. The change to the term “sentence” reflects the greater emphasis on accountability in the YCJA, though the term disposition is still sometimes used informally for YCJA sentences.

In a dual procedure, the Crown prosecutor has the choice to proceed by summary conviction or by indictment for a hybrid or Crown electable offence. (In Canada, all criminal offences are divided into one of three categories: summary conviction, indictable, and dual procedure offences.) The distinction between summary conviction and indictable offences is based on the formality of the procedures used to try them. Once the Crown has made its decision, the offence is subject to the normal rules of procedure for a summary conviction or indictable offence.

Refers to the idea that the legal rights of a person in the criminal or youth justice system are protected, in particular, the expectation that an accused person will have access to legal representation and a fair hearing. The trend toward adoption of a due process model of justice in Canada was reflected in and reinforced by the adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982. The Juvenile Delinquents Act placed much less emphasis on due process than the Young Offenders Act. The Youth Criminal Justice Act also maintains a due process model of juvenile justice.

Duress
<definition>
A defence available to those who commit crimes because they are threatened with serious harm. A codified defence of duress is found in section 17 of the Criminal Code and applies to principal offenders. The requirements of immediacy and presence in section 17 of the Code have been severed from the defence as unconstitutional. A common law defence of duress applies to parties to offences. In some rare circumstances, duress may also be relevant to the proof of the fault element.

Criminal Procedure 3/e - Steve Coughlan
<definition>
The doctrine of election applies where a plaintiff wishes to pursue alternative claims arising from the same factual incident but which are premised upon the assertion of inconsistent legal rights. Thus, a plaintiff may maintain an action for both specific performance and, in the alternative, damages for breach of contract, but will be required to make an election prior to judgment as to which claim he wishes to pursue. The specific performance claim is premised upon the plaintiff wishing to enforce the contract and remaining ready, willing, and able to perform, while the damages claim is premised on the plaintiff accepting the breach and treating the contract as discharged forthwith.

Equality
<definition>
In Canada, the legal right guaranteed by section 15 of the Charter. Equality is a highly debated concept, but means, at least, that people are entitled to equal treatment from the state in respect of fundamental goods and services. In Canadian law, "equality" is measured against a guarantee of freedom from discrimination, that is, from being singled out for harmful treatment because of personal characteristics such as sex or race. Equality is also described in terms of a formal guarantee of "similar" treatment, say, in being subject to the same laws as everyone else; and as a further guarantee of "substantive equality" that recognizes that "similar treatment" is not always sufficient to ensure equality. Both meanings have been endorsed in Canadian law.

Estoppel
<definition>
A legal bar, from medieval law French, meaning "stop." For example, assignors are estopped from challenging their assignee's title, and licensees are estopped from challenging their licensor's title: the assignor or licensee sued by the assignee or licensor for infringement cannot defend by (is estopped from) showing that the right is invalid. Hence, the terms "assignor estoppel" and "licensee estoppel." Someone may be estopped without intending or knowing it. Thus, if A leads B to assume that a certain state of affairs exists, and it would be unfair to let A have a change of heart in the light of what has since happened, B's assumption is treated as true: that is, A is estopped from denying its validity.

Evergreening
<definition>
A colourful colloquialism of slightly shady connotation, referring to the practice by which an IP right-holder seeks to extend the duration of protection by adding further IP rights to his initial right. So  nineteenth-century publishers would encourage authors or editors to update or revise publications near the end of the term of copyright; the new edition could then be marketed as “new and improved” and could depress the sale of the competing but now less attractive out-of-copyright work. The practice still continues: “approved” editions of James Joyce’s works, authorized by Joyce’s heirs, may seem more attractive than “unapproved” reprints. Elsewhere patent holders trawl for aspects of their invention which they further patent (e.g., new dosages of patented drugs), or obtain trade-marks over some feature of the invention so that those copying the no longer patented invention will now be sued for trade-mark infringement or passing-off. Wily rights-holders can thus turn decidedly “deciduous” finite terms of protection lives into “evergreen” infinite terms, unless thwarted by a wilier CIPO or court.

Ex parte injunction
<definition>
A term literally meaning "from one side"; an application is ex parte when it is made to a court or tribunal without notifying or serving anyone else with the proceedings. Because of the proceeding's one-sided nature, applicants owe the decision-maker a high duty of good faith; in practice, this means they should reveal to the decision-maker any objections that might result in a decision adverse to them.

The exemption method provides relief from double taxation by exempting income that is subject to tax in the state of source from tax in the state of residence. The exemption method refers to the amount of income that is subject to tax. Hence, a taxpayer can be affected by the difference in tax rates between the state of source and the state of residence.

The exemption with progression method prevents a taxpayer from taking advantage of a lower tax bracket in the state of residence by earning income abroad.

CIPO, Copyright, Federal Court of Canada, Impeach
<definition>
A term meaning to strike or delete; it is used in this book in relation to an entry on the copyright or other intellectual property (e.g., ICT) register. The CIPO can expunge entries in limited specified circumstances — for example, for a clerical error. More usually, the Federal Court exercises this power. Expungement invalidates the right as against the world, not merely the parties to the litigation. An entry may also be amended, corrected, or rectified, a lesser remedy than expungement, which changes, but does not delete, the entry.

A program outside the formal court system established under section 10 of the YCJA to deal with youth who have committed offences. Some extrajudicial sanctions programs operate pre-charge and accept police referrals of youth believed to have committed offences but who are not charged, while other programs are post-charge and accept referrals from the police or Crown of youth who have been charged.The fact that a youth has participated in extrajudicial sanctions may be a factor in sentencing if there are later proceedings for another offence.

<definition>
A flow-through share is available to mining and petroleum companies to facilitate financing their exploration and development activities. These equity shares are issued by resource companies to new investors. Investors receive an equity interest in the company and income tax deductions associated with new expenditures incurred by the company on exploration and development. Flow-through shares are available to all mining and petroleum companies, but are of greater benefit to non-taxpaying junior exploration companies. These companies are unable to use income tax deductions for exploration and development against their corporate income and are willing to forgo the deduction to new investors.

Fractional share
<related_terms>
Share
<definition>
Less than one whole share. Various events can create fractions of shares issued by a corporation. If a corporation consolidates its shares on some basis, shareholders may end up with less than a whole share. For example, if all common shares of a corporation were consolidated on a ten for one basis, a holder of five shares would end up holding just one-half of a share. Fractional shares can also arise on certain kinds of corporate reorganizations, such as amalgamations, where existing shares of each amalgamating corporation are exchanged for shares of the corporation that results from the amalgamation. Under the CBCA, corporations may purchase fractional shares for cancellation so long as certain financial tests are met (s. 34).

Government of Canada
<definition>
The framework of political institutions by means of which the state carries on its executive, judicial, legislative, and administrative functions. In Canada, the term “government” includes the governor general, Cabinet, individual ministers, and the thousands of public servants within all departments of government. Also included are certain Crown corporations and agencies that are not within the formal governmental structure but are subject to a high degree of ministerial control, and thus are deemed to be “agents” of the Crown.

The Laws of Government 2/e - Craig Forcese and Aaron Freeman
<definition>
The Queen in Canada is represented federally by the Governor General and provincially by the various Lieutenant Governors. In legal research parlance, you will often see in statutes the phrase that the “Governor General in Council” or “Lieutenant Governor in Council” be empowered to enact regulations. This does not mean these representatives of the Queen are themselves drafting regulations; instead the task is effectively left in the hands of Cabinet and committees of Cabinet who would carry out the regulation-making powers and submit the necessary paperwork to the Governor General (or Lieutenant Governor, provincially speaking) for signature.

Goods and Services Tax (GST), Input tax credits
<definition>
Taxable (including zero-rated) sales by all sectors are eligible for full rebate of tax paid on associated inputs through the input tax credit mechanism. However, certain sectors are also eligible for rebates of a portion of the GST paid on inputs into exempt sales. These rebates go to qualifying public-sector bodies such as municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals (MUSH), as well as to qualifying public service organizations such as charities and non-profit organizations. GST rebates to these institutions minimize the impact of the GST on the cost of providing exempt public services. Other GST rebates include a rebate to foreign tourists for GST paid on hotel accommodation in Canada and goods taken out of the country, as well as a rebate of a portion of the GST paid on the purchase of a new home (excluding rental properties).

Though not part of the Constitution of Canada, the various human rights codes have been recognized as reflecting fundamental values of Canadian society. Unlike the Charter of Rights and Freedoms which applies only to the relationship between the state and individual, human rights codes must be obeyed by both government and private individuals/corporations. Violations of human rights codes are subject to a variety of remedies, including damages.

Partner
<definition>
A promise by one person to compensate another person for an obligation incurred or payment made by the second person. Usually, an indemnity is given for obligations or payments imposed on the second person caused by something that the first person did. One partner, for example, may agree to indemnify the other partners for payments that the other partners are forced to make under obligations that the first partner imposes on the partnership in breach of the partnership agreement. Corporate statutes provide that corporations must indemnify officers, directors, and certain other persons for expenses incurred in connection with performing duties for or at the request of the corporation, but only if certain requirements are satisfied (e.g., CBCA, s. 124). Corporations have a discretion to indemnify in a broader range of circumstances.

<definition>
Those offences that are labelled as such by the Criminal Code or other federal statutes. These offences are subject to more serious penalties than summary conviction offences. The accused also has the right to elect how he will be tried: by a judge without a jury, or a court composed of a judge and jury. However, for certain offences, the Ontario Court of Justice has “absolute jurisdiction”; that is, the jurisdiction of the Ontario Court of Justice to try the accused does not depend on the consent of the accused.

The category of criminal offences that are subject to formal and complex procedures. Generally, indictable offences are more serious than summary conviction offences are, and they carry lengthy maximum sentences. For example, impaired driving causing death is an indictable offence and is subject to a maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment. Most indictable offences give the accused the right to elect to be tried in a higher court by a judge alone or with a jury.

Individual characteristics
<definition>
Individual characteristics are generally considered to be exceptional characteristics that may establish the uniqueness of an object and support the conclusion that the object in question can be linked to a known object (i.e., both the questioned and known object originated from a common source). For example, marks on various parts of a firearm that come into contact with the bullet/cartridge case may create individual characteristics that are produced by the random imperfections or irregularities on the surfaces of those parts. These individual characteristics are produced incidental to manufacture and/or caused by wear, corrosion, or damage. They are considered to be unique to that tool, but they are not always visualized in sufficient quantity on fired bullets/cartridges.

Inherent jurisdiction
<definition>
Every court which is a “superior court of record” has an inherent jurisdiction. A superior court of record is the basic level of superior court found in every province and can trace its origins back to the English courts prior to settlement. In contrast, courts can be statutory courts and must look to their empowering statute to determine jurisdiction. Superior courts of record have an inherent jurisdiction to create new rights and remedies consistent with common law methodology and to fulfill the adage that there is no right without a remedy. Superior courts of record, and most statutory courts, also have an inherent jurisdiction to create processes to govern the practices of how the court handles its affairs. Within the second concept of inherent jurisdiction, courts have, for example, evolved search and asset preservation orders.

Intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision

Community supervision, Conditional supervision, Custody, Deferred custody and supervision, Intensive support and supervision, Presumptive offence, Provincial director, Youth justice court
<definition>
A sentence of intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision may be imposed under section 42(2)(r) of the YCJA for a youth found guilty of one of most serious offences, namely murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault, or a third offence involving causing or attempting to cause serious bodily harm, and if the youth is suffering from a mental or emotional disturbance. A youth receiving this sentence is placed in a facility that has more rehabilitative resources than an ordinary custody facility, which may be a mental health facility. A youth justice court may make an order for intensive rehabilitative custody only if a “plan of treatment and intensive community supervision” has been developed and the provincial director consents. The sentence includes a period of conditional supervision in the community, which is subject to stricter legal controls than for a youth released on community supervision following the custodial portion of an ordinary order of custody and supervision.

A community-based sentence of intensive support and supervision may be imposed under section 42(2)(l) of the YCJA.

The youth might, for example, be required by the provincial director to attend a particular educational or treatment program every day. A youth justice court may make an order for intensive support and supervision only if the provincial director consents. The maximum duration is two years.

Public international law
<definition>
Generally, public international law, or the body of laws governing relations between nation-states. International law deals with the legal responsibility of states in their conduct with each other. International law is also used to govern issues relating to the global environment, the global commons such as international waters and outer space, global communications, and world trade. But international law can also be concerned with the treatment of individuals within state boundaries. Some international treaties, for example, those regarding refugees or war crimes, are binding on the Government of Canada when incorporated into Canada's legal system. Further, international human rights, a relatively new sub-set of international law, outlines the rights of individuals against a government either in the country where they are a citizen or where they reside.

A term used loosely to refer to a wide variety of legal arrangements in which one or more parties combine their resources for some limited purpose, for a limited time, or both. It is not a distinct form of business organization, nor a relationship that has any precise legal meaning. A joint venture may be established, for example, by a contract in which the joint venturers agree that they will do certain things to carry out their common purpose; by two people carrying on business together, in which case the joint venture is a partnership; or by two people forming a corporation to carry out their common purpose. While the legal consequences of a joint venture that is a corporation or a partnership are clear, the legal consequences of a joint venture relationship that is not a partnership or a corporation are not.

Juridical double taxation
<related_terms>
Economic double taxation
<definition>
Juridical double taxation refers to circumstances where a taxpayer is subject to tax on the same income (or capital) in more than one jurisdiction. For example, a resident of Canada who is also considered to be a resident of the United States would be potentially subject to concurrent full taxation in both countries. Bilateral tax treaties generally tend to eliminate (or at least reduce) the possibility of juridical double taxation.

<definition>
At one level, jurisdiction refers to a set boundary or territory; hence, “Canada” is a jurisdiction with specific borders and defined geographic space. Jurisdiction also refers to a notion of juridical power; hence, one can speak of “federal” or “provincial” jurisdiction (based on the division of powers in the Constitution Act, 1867) or whether, for example, a small claims court judge has jurisdiction (i.e., legitimate power) to hear a defamation claim.

Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)
<definition>
Legal materials (typically books) need to be organized on the shelf to allow for the orderly retrieval of information. The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. has a system for organizing material by topic that is used by major libraries throughout the world. Library of Congress Subject Headings are a controlled vocabulary used to describe the topic of a book. Thus, all books in a law library that relate to human rights law in Ontario will be assigned the subject heading “Human rights — Ontario” and searching in an online library catalogue on that specific subject heading will retrieve all books on that subject held by the library. Related to these subject headings are Library of Congress call numbers that are assigned to a book depending on the book’s topic. The “Law of Canada” is usually assigned the starting letters “KE” followed by a number that relates to the topic (KE 850 would likely be a book on Canadian contract law). Some Canadian law libraries, however, use the “KF” letters to organize their Canadian legal materials (KF is ordinarily the “Law of America” and when Canadian law libraries use KF for Canadian materials, it is referred to as “KF Modified”).

<definition>
A special form of partnership permitted in most provinces for use by identified professions that shield individual partners from some liabilities incurred by other partners and by the firm. In some provinces, like Ontario, partners are protected against most liabilities other than liabilities arising out of their own negligence or the negligence of employees and others under their direct supervision. In other provinces, like Alberta, partners in limited liability partnerships benefit from narrower protection. They are not liable for the negligence of other partners or employees except in limited circumstances. In all provinces, the firm’s assets may be used to satisfy claims arising out of actions by the partners See Ontario Partnerships Act ss. 10 and 44.1–44.4

<definition>
A partnership where at least one of the partners, the general partner, has unlimited liability and at least one other, called a limited partner, has limited liability. The liability of the limited partner is limited, typically, to the amount she has contributed or agreed to contribute to the limited partnership. In general partnerships, all partners are general partners in the sense that they all have unlimited personal liability. Limited partnerships come into existence only upon a filing being made with the appropriate government authority under provincial limited partnership legislation. Limited partners cannot take part in the management of the business of the partnership or allow their name to be used in the firm name without losing their limited liability status.

Meech Lake Accord
<definition>
The 1987 agreement between the prime minister and the ten provincial premiers reached at Meech Lake, Quebec, proposing a series of constitutional changes designed to secure the consent of the government of Quebec to the Constitution Act, 1982. The most controversial of the proposed changes was the constitutional entrenchment of the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. By 22 June 1990 the accord had been ratified by resolutions of the Senate, House of Commons, and eight provincial legislatures. However, because it required the approval of all ten provinces within a three-year period, it failed to become law in Canada.

Berne Convention , Treaty
<definition>
An obligation to extend the rights a state grants its own citizens, residents, and corporations to foreign citizens, residents, and corporations without discrimination. Most international intellectual property treaties oblige their adherents to extend national treatment to one another, but not necessarily to non-adherents.

The other states do the same for Canadians.

The principle of parliamentary supremacy has been further limited by the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, which placed certain entrenched individual and group rights beyond the power of either level of government.

Patent
<related_terms>
Injunction, Patent Appeal Board, Patentee, POSITA, Reissue, Usefulness; utility
<definition>
A term used here to denote a patent for invention, an exclusive right granted to work new inventions. It is sometimes called "letters patent," from the Latin litterae patentes ("open letters"), meaning that the royal seal was placed at the bottom of the document, making the document a public record open for all to see. The Patent Act still defines "patent" as "letters patent for an invention," being one species of the genus of letters patent, which at various times covered franchises, land grants, honours, and company incorporations.A patent lasts for twenty years from the date when the application for it is filed, but the actual monopoly starts when the patent is granted, typically around two years later. The application is made public no later than eighteen months after the filing of the application. If a patent is granted, the patentee can get compensation from unauthorized users of the invention as from the date of making public. An injunction and money remedies are available against unauthorized uses after the date of grant.

A permanent establishment is a fixed place of business through which an enterprise carries on its business in whole or in part. The concept of permanent establishment applies when a state determines that, under its domestic law, the business profits of a resident of another state may be taxable.

<definition>
An agreement about the resolution of charges, usually made between the Crown prosecutor and defence counsel, that the accused will plead guilty to one or more charges if the Crown drops other charges or agrees to make “joint submissions” (with the defence counsel) about an appropriate sentence. While the judge is not bound to follow a joint submission or plea bargain about a sentence, it is usually adopted by the court. The term “plea resolution discussion” is sometimes used in more formal contexts instead of “plea bargain,” to emphasize that the court is not bound by the outcome of these discussions.

Copyright, Intellectual property, Licence, Trade-mark
<definition>
In copyright, the better title to a proprietary interest when a right has been assigned or licensed more than once. So if A purports to assign the same copyright to B and then later to C, C will have priority if its title is better than B's. This means C owns the copyright and B can claim against A only for breach of contract. Registration of the copyright by B or C may affect this result.

Copyright Law - David Vaver Foreword by Beverley McLachlin
<definition>
(1) The right to acquire an intellectual property right where competing applications are filed. In trade-mark law, the earlier of the first to use or file usually has priority; in patent law, the first to file for a claimed invention usually has priority. Both may be bumped by a later Canadian filing based on a timely foreign application with an earlier filing date.(2) The better title to a proprietary interest when a right has been assigned or licensed more than once. So if A assigns the same right to B and then later to C, C will have priority if its title is better than B's. This means that C owns the right and that B can claim against A only for breach of contract. Priorities for intellectual property are not standardized. Provincial law, sometimes overlaid by federal law (e.g., for patents, copyrights, and PBRs), usually governs. Typically, who registers a right first, and whether C is a good-faith buyer without knowledge of B's interest, are important factors.

<definition>
A term used colloquially and in many places in this book, along with “private corporation,” to refer to any corporation that has a small number of shareholders, and the shares of which do not trade in a public market. Previously, “private company” was defined in the Ontario Securities Act as a corporation whose articles provide that the number of shareholders shall not exceed fifty, exclusive of employees and former employees, share transfer is restricted and any invitation to the public to subscribe for its securities is prohibited. Shares of such a corporation could be traded without complying with the requirement to file a prospectus under the Securities Act. This exemption has been replaced by the “private issuer” exemption.

Prosecutorial discretion
<related_terms>
Prosecutor
<definition>
The constitutional principle that the Attorney General and Crown prosecutors are entitled to act independently in making prosecutorial decisions and that decisions made as part of that discretion are not reviewable by courts, short of an abuse of process. Core elements of prosecutorial discretion include the discretion whether to continue or stay a prosecution, whether to accept a guilty plea to a lesser chage, and whether to take control of a private prosecution.
