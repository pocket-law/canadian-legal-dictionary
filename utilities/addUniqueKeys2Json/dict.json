The appellant, Anton Piller, was a German manufacturer of motors and electric generators used in the computing industry. The respondent was the appellant's agent in the United Kingdom. As agents the respondents had received confidential information surrounding the appellant's business. The appellants found out that the respondents had been in secret communication with other German companies called Ferrostaal and Lechmotoren with a view to giving those companies detailed plans and drawings of the appellant's products so that they could be copied. The appellants were about to launch a new product and feared that details of it might get into the hands of competitors if the respondents were forewarned that the appellants were aware of the respondents' breaches of confidence. Anton Piller commenced ex parte proceedings seeking an injunction to restrain copyright infringement as well as a court order to permit entry to the respondent's premises to search and remove all confidential information owned by the appellants. The injunction was granted but the order for inspection and removal was refused. The appellants appealed the denial of the latter order. In the Court of Appeal the order was granted. From this initial order has grown the jurisprudence on Anton Piller orders, commonly known as civil search warrants.",

So  nineteenth-century publishers would encourage authors or editors to update or revise publications near the end of the term of copyright; the new edition could then be marketed as “new and improved” and could depress the sale of the competing but now less attractive out-of-copyright work. The practice still continues: “approved” editions of James Joyce’s works, authorized by Joyce’s heirs, may seem more attractive than “unapproved” reprints. Elsewhere patent holders trawl for aspects of their invention which they further patent (e.g., new dosages of patented drugs), or obtain trade-marks over some feature of the invention so that those copying the no longer patented invention will now be sued for trade-mark infringement or passing-off. Wily rights-holders can thus turn decidedly “deciduous” finite terms of protection lives into “evergreen” infinite terms, unless thwarted by a wilier CIPO or court.",

Thus, all books in a law library that relate to human rights law in Ontario will be assigned the subject heading “Human rights — Ontario” and searching in an online library catalogue on that specific subject heading will retrieve all books on that subject held by the library. Related to these subject headings are Library of Congress call numbers that are assigned to a book depending on the book’s topic. The “Law of Canada” is usually assigned the starting letters “KE” followed by a number that relates to the topic (KE 850 would likely be a book on Canadian contract law). Some Canadian law libraries, however, use the “KF” letters to organize their Canadian legal materials (KF is ordinarily the “Law of America” and when Canadian law libraries use KF for Canadian materials, it is referred to as “KF Modified”).",

		"definition": "A term used here to denote a patent for invention, an exclusive right granted to work new inventions. It is sometimes called \"letters patent,\" from the Latin litterae patentes (\"open letters\"), meaning that the royal seal was placed at the bottom of the document, making the document a public record open for all to see. The Patent Act still defines \"patent\" as \"letters patent for an invention,\" being one species of the genus of letters patent, which at various times covered franchises, land grants, honours, and company incorporations.A patent lasts for twenty years from the date when the application for it is filed, but the actual monopoly starts when the patent is granted, typically around two years later. The application is made public no later than eighteen months after the filing of the application. If a patent is granted, the patentee can get compensation from unauthorized users of the invention as from the date of making public. An injunction and money remedies are available against unauthorized uses after the date of grant.",

Rescission in equity operates to roll the contract back to the position the parties were in prior to contracting. This is referred to as rescission ab initio, or \"from the beginning.\" It is to be distinguished from rescission de futuro, or \"for the future.\" The latter terminology is unwisely used to describe the position of a plaintiff who is entitled to terminate a contract for breach. As an equitable remedy rescission is subject to a number of discretionary barriers including delay and affirmation. It is also important for the plaintiff to be able to effect restitutio in integrium. That requires both parties to be restored to their pre-contractual positions. The degree of complete restoration will vary depending on the particular underlying cause of action. In the case of fraud a court will be less particular with giving complete restoration, whereas for an innocent misrepresentation, anything less that complete restoration will bar rescission.",

Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. wrote: “In general terms, restorative justice may be described as an approach to remedying crime in which it is understood that all things are interrelated and that crime disrupts the harmony which existed prior to its occurrence, or at least which it is felt should exist. The appropriateness of a particular sanction is largely determined by the needs of the victims, and the community, as well as the offender. The focus is on the human beings closely affected by the crime” (at 726).",

Thus, a copyright holder can get an injunction to prevent the translation of her work, however much money the user tenders for the right and however worthy the enterprise. On the other hand, the owner of a right of remuneration cannot prevent the use of his material by any user who tenders the prescribed fee. For example, the copyright holder of a published sound recording of a musical work cannot prevent a broadcaster who tenders the appropriate payment from airing any sound recording; the Copyright Act grants the right-holder only a right of remuneration in respect of this activity.",

The 2012 amendments expanded the concept of violent offence to include offences where the youth endangers the life or safety of another, even if there is no intent to cause harm. The fact that a youth is charged with a violent offence means that the youth may be eligible for pre-trial detention or custody, and even if it is a first offence, there is no presumption of use of extrajudicial sanctions. ",

The decisions of Ontario workplace administrative tribunals can be overturned (appealed) only by making application for judicial review to the Divisional Court.\n\nThe following are the primary private sector workplace administrative tribunals in Ontario:\n\n-> Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO)\n->Ontario Labour Relations Board (OLRB)\n->Pay Equity Hearings Tribunal\n->Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal\n->An arbitrator appointed under the provisions of a collective agreement is also a workplace administrative tribunal.\n\n In addition to the above list, there are specialized workplace administrative tribunals that deal with specific public sector employment issues, for example, the Grievance Settlement Board for Ontario, which adjudicates the grievances of Crown employees in the Ontario public service.",

The typical Court of Equity decision would prevent a person from enforcing a common law court judgment. The kings delegated this special judicial review power over common law court rulings to chancellors. A new branch of law developed known as \"equity\", with their decisions eventually gaining precedence over those of the common law courts. A whole set of equity law principles were developed based on the predominant \"fairness\" characteristic of equity such as \"equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy\" or \"he who comes to equity must come with clean hands\".
